# LLMDebate â€” 3 Super Simple LLMs That Debate Each Other

This small demo runs a debate between three toy "LLM" models (no external APIs required). Each model is a lightweight, template-driven generator with different personalities: Proponent (pro), Opponent (con), and Moderator (neutral).

New behavior:
- The user supplies the topic (first input).
- A starting AI is chosen at random.
- On each subsequent turn the next speaker is chosen so their stance is adversarial to the previous non-neutral stance (so no two consecutive responses share the same opinion).
- If the previous speaker was neutral (Moderator), the next speaker is chosen randomly to be pro or con.
- If multiple eligible models could speak, the selection is random.
- Moderator remains neutral: it summarizes or reframes rather than taking a pro/con stance.

## CLI Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Run the CLI:

```
python debate.py "Should we colonize Mars?" --turns 6
```

### Options
- `--turns N` : total number of speaker turns (default 6)
- `--seed S` : optional integer seed for deterministic randomness (useful for reproducible runs)

Example:

```
python debate.py "Universal basic income?" --turns 5 --seed 42
```

## Graphical Interface (macOS)

A small Tkinter-based GUI (`gui.py`) lets you run debates without the terminal.

```
python gui.py
```

To package the GUI as a standalone `.app` on macOS, install
[`pyinstaller`](https://pyinstaller.org/) and run:

```
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed gui.py
```

The resulting application appears in `dist/gui.app`. Move it to your
`Applications` folder and launch. The interface lets you enter a topic, run the debate, copy the transcript, or save it to a text file.

## Notes

- The models here are intentionally tiny and deterministic with small randomness to vary wording.
- You can extend `models.py` to wrap real LLM APIs (OpenAI, local models) if you want real generation.
